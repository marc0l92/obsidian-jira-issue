# Introduction

## Why this plugin?
As a developer that works in a IT company I work every day on many topics that I love to record and document in my notes.

I evaluated several note taking applications, but the one that I found more compatible with a working environment workflow is [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

With this plugin I wanted to connect my notes with the word of [Atlassian Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) issues that I work on, in order to be able to monitor the user story I create but also link user stories that I'm working on.

The plugin is inspired by the integration between Confluence and Jira, and I wanted to reproduce the same style in order to create something that Atlassian user are familiar with.

## Who is this plugin for?

- Developers
