### 🏷️Inline issues
- [Documentation](https://marc0l92.github.io/obsidian-jira-issue/docs/components/inline-issue)
- Example:
````
With inline issue you can insert an issue like JIRA:OPEN-351 inside your text.
The plugin will detect urls like https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/OPEN-352 and render the issue as tags.
- [ ] Issue can be extended JIRA:OPEN-353 with the summary
- [x] Or compact JIRA:-OPEN-354 without the summary
- [ ] JIRA:-OPEN-355 use the `-` symbol before the issue key to make it compact
```
The plugin searches inside the note for those patterns and replace them
JIRA:-OPEN-356
```
